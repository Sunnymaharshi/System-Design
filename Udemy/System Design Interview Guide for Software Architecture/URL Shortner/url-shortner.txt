Functional Requirements 
    Get Short URL 
    Redirect to Long URL 
Non Functional Requirements
    Very low latency 
    Very high Availability 

Solution 
    Define len of short URL according to how many short URLs you want to create 
        length is 7
    until what duration u need to support short URL?
    What characters can be included in Short URL?
        a-z,A-Z,0-9 -> 62 characters
    Generate Short URL 
        if we have multiple systems trying to generate short URL
        there could be generate same URL (collision)
        Redis 
            it always gives unique number 
            unique number at base 10 converted to base 62
            if we have single redis, it could not keepup with requests 
            if we have multiple redis, we need to make sure they generate different numbers which is complex
            Redis is not useful
        Short URL Service
            if we could generate a number from Long URL 
                even if we have multiple instances, they always generate unique number 
            then convert that number(base 10) to base 62 
            Assign a range for each instance 
                request Token Service for a range 
                after range is completed instance again request for range 
                Token Service 
                    running on single thread 
                    gives a range to requested instance
                    uses MySQL Database to keep track of ranges 
            if service shutsdown it's range is lost 
    Redirect to Long URL 
        use Cassandra for storing URLs
