Clarify 
    Ask if it is Low Level Design(LLD) or High Level Design(HLD)
    What features u should focus on?
    What scale we need?
    Manage ur time well, tell main components and how they interact and then ask which one to go in depth.
    Tell if u don't know how to build a particular component and explain how you will do it.

Choosing right database
    depends on
        Data
            Structured data 
                need ACID support
                    RDMS
                    ex:MySQL,Oracle,Postgres SQL
                no need for ACID 
                    can use RDMS or NoSQL
            Non-structured data
                Data types, Queries
                    Document DB 
                    ex: MongoDB,Couchbase DB 
                Ever increasing data, finite queries 
                    Columnar DB 
                    ex: Cassandra, HBase 
        Query pattern 
        Amount of scale u need 
    Caching
    File storage
        Blob storage
            images, videos etc 
            ex: Amazon S3 
    Text Search engine 
        ex: Elastic Search
        Fuzzy Search
            if user enters incorrect spelling u need to figure out correct one 
            level of Fuzzyness can be provided
    Time series database    
        usecase: storing metrics of application/server 
        ex: InfluxDB, openTSDB (open time series database)
    Analytics 
        ex: Hadoop
        for data warehousing 

Cassandra
    data is partitioned into different nodes
    can handle large amount of data 
    good 
        sequential search 
        search using partition id
    bad
        random search
        aggregation
